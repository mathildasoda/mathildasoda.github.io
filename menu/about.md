Hello! I'm Mathilda Nguyen, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI & ML, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My main interest lies in statistical modeling.

# Organizations

[University of Pennsylvania - Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/): I'm working on improving Bayesian Neural Network models for inferrence of structural parameters of galaxies

[Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health](montai.com): I worked at a Computational Modelling Scientist at Montai for 6 months, during which time I created an ML model to predict some biological properties. On the side, my projects include coding up Bayesian models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)

[Group One Trading LP](group1.com): I interned as a trading analyst for 6 months. I learnt option tradings and presented to the firm my market research on possible future legislation and how it might affect tradings

[Drexel Mathematics department](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/mathematics/): Studied Hamiltonian Monte Carlo under professor Mondaini

[Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/): an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I did research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods (sequential monte carlo)

[Drexel Computer Science Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html): a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), where I gave a talk on Multi Arm bandit algorithm

[Drexel College of Computing and Informatics](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/clc/Fa21/index.html): I am a Teaching Assistant for courses: Data Structure (fall 2021, winter 2022, spring 2022), Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science (fall 2021), Computer Programming I (fall 2022) & II (winter 2023)
