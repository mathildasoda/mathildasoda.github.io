Hello, I'm Mathilda. Currently, I'm a post-baccalaureate working at Los Alamos on sampling methods. 

My main interest lies in Bayesian statistics, and applying mathematical/computational methods to problems in the sciences.

In 2024, I finished my undergraduate with a B.S in Mathematics and a B.S in Computer Science (tracks: AI & ML, Numerical & Symbolic computation). I also hold an Intermediate Proficiency Certificate in German, and a minor in Linguistics.

# Experience
**Los Alamos National Lab - Theoretical division** (post-bacc): Researching sampling methods for high dimensional problems; continuing the geomorphology project from previous division on the side

**Los Alamos National Lab - Earth & Environmental division** (post-bacc): Contributed to computational fire dynamics code; developing methods in geomorphology

**University of Pennsylvania - Department of Physics & Astronomy** (research assistant): Worked on improving Bayesian Neural Network models for inferrence of structural parameters of galaxies, which became my senior thesis (and earned me third prize in thesis research category). I got the chance to see the launch of Euclid telescope in person due to my PI's involvement in the project, which was very exciting

**Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health** (computational modelling scientist): Created a machine learning model to predict certain biological properties. On the side, my projects include improving and coding up Bayesian models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for inferrence of biological effects from 2D (quasi-spatial) and 1D data

**Group One Trading LP** (trading analyst) Learnt option tradings and did some projects relating to it 

**Drexel Wireless Systems Lab** (research intern): Did research on sequential monte carlo

**Drexel College of Computing and Informatics** (teaching assistant) for courses: Data Structure, Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science, Computer Programming I & II. I graded written and programming tests/homeworks, proctored exams, hosted labs sessions and office hours

**Computer Science Theory Reading Group**: a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), where I gave a talk on Multi-armed Bandits algorithm

# Trivia

I like linux's open source philosophy and customizability (I use [artix](https://artixlinux.org/) these days). 

I drive a '93 miata.
