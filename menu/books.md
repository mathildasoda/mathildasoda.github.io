List of books I've read and a few lines of my impression of them (please don't take them to heart). Unfortunately you won't find any textbooks here (yet?).

I decided to make this list because I don't read so much anymore and I don't want to forget what I have read, and also because this serves as a great way to share my book list with my book friends.

**Author-wise**, I really like Kafka and Vonnegut. I used to like Haruki Murakami a lot and has read a good chunk of his books, but since hitting 20s I've had a style-related fall-out with him (I wonder whether it was because I read his books in English now and the feel is completely different...).


# The list

**Brave New World** (Huxley): had i loved it less, i would've been able to talk about it more

**Sapiens** (Harari): profound impact on my perception of human in general. I couldn't put it down

**Metamagical Themas** (Hofstadter): i picked this book up for reasons i can't remember. Went through it during the pandemic. The reason why i became a maths major (though i don't specialize in Logic)

**Gödel, Escher, Bach** (Hofstadter): every maths major know of this book - I have only read a few sections and it might or might not stay that way for the rest of my life

**Letters to the father** (Kafka): read this at a public library when I was 13. Brought me to tears.

**Letters to Milena** (Kafka): Kafka honestly write the best love letters.

**Love, Kurt** (Vonnegut): collection of love letters by Kurt Vonnegut.

**When breath becomes air** (Kalanithi): absolutely broke me

**Man's search for meaning** (Frankl): would have absolutely broke me for the same reason as Kalanithi's book had it not been for the fact that Frankl's work is somewhat more optimistic

**The metamorphosis** (Kafka): i already know what happened more or less and only read it out of love for Kafka. The ending was very unexpected and very abrupt

**What I talk about when I talk about running** (Murakami): ok book. Might or might not be the only non-fiction by Murakami i read

**The sirens of titan** (Vonnegut): reading this book is an amazing journey

**Cat's cradle** (Vonnegut): first serious read from Vonnegut

**God bless you, Dr Kevorkian** (Vonnegut): entertaining

**If this isn't nice, what is?: Advice to the young** (Vonnegut): nice read

**Harrison Bergeron** (Vonnegut): googling it made me realized that this is Vonnegut's creation! Wow! Read it a few years ago and the imagery stuck with me. Very short and very interesting.

**All summer in a day** (Bradbury): only a few pages and will be worth a few minutes of your time

**The stranger** (Camus): the ending is absolutely, absolutely beautiful.

**1984** (Orwell): great

**Animal farm** (Orwell): good

**Catcher in the rhye** (Salinger): it might be too "cringe" for me now but back when i first read it it was ok. My sister's favorite book.

**Anne Frank** (Frank): insightful

**The Little Prince** (Saint-Exupéry): wonderful!

**Kafka on the shore** (Murakami): one of the first Murakami works i read in English, the story is... alright - characteristic Murakami style, which by this time i've gotten tired of so that colored my opinion somewhat

**Wind-up bird chronicle** (Murakami): good. One of Murakami's works i actually retain somewhat the plot:w

**Norwegian wood** (Murakami): good. I don't really understand the hype however...

**1Q84** (Murakami): I only read the first book. My impression at the time is that it was good

**South of the border, west of the sun** (Murakami): don't remember much from this book

**Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and his years of pilgrimage** (Murakami): one of Murakami's book i actually bought (not for any particular reason). I have great memory of it.

**Men without women** (Murakami): alright

**Hear the wind sing** (Murakami): didn't remember much

**My life as a quant** (Derman): insightful. Derman is trained in Physics and so i understand his points about life in finance

**Liar's poker** (Lewis): will be recommended if you ever worked in trading and asked for book to read. Great book.

**Chaos** (Gleick): very beautiful! Introduced me to the life of many many great mathematicians and got me to think about PDEs differently (visually)

**No exit** (Satre): the piece of work where "hell is other people" originated from. Really good

**Dirty hands** (Satre): interesting work

**Critique of pure reason** (Kant): bought it after reading the summary on the back cover. Anyone out there who might benefit more from having this book please do not hesitate to contact me.

**No longer human** (Dazai): i read this when i was way too young for it to really sink in. Maybe a blessing in disguise

**Setting sun** (Dazai): just wow. Still remember the story after all these years. Might be the greatest Japanese work i've ever read

**One hundred views of mount Fuji** (Dazai): great, short work

**Kitchen** (Yoshimoto): really peaceful read

**N.P** (Yoshimoto): alright

**Totto-chan, the little girl at the window** (Kuroyanagi): really cute

**Myth of Sisyphus** (Camus): I read this quite a few years ago - didn't really get it

**Catch-22** (Heller): i couldn't finish it. The book was good however

**Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman!** (Feynman): incredible book! I had fun reading it. Feynman's personality seems to be a bit like that of Vonnegut's

**The fault in our stars** (Green): made me really sad

**Packing for Mars** (Roach): one of the greatest books i've read when i was young

**Foundation series** (Asimov): i'm trying to finish it but asimov's misogyny makes it difficult
