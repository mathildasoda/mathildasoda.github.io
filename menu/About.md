Hello! I'm Mathilda, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI & ML, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My main interest lies in statistical modeling.

# Organizations

**University of Pennsylvania - Department of Physics & Astronomy**: I'm working on improving Bayesian Neural Network models for inferrence of structural parameters of galaxies

**Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health**: I worked at a Computational Modelling Scientist at Montai for 6 months, during which time I created an ML model to predict some biological properties. On the side, my projects include coding up Bayesian models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)

**Group One Trading LP**: I interned as a trading analyst for 6 months. I learnt option tradings and presented to the firm my market research on possible future legislation and how it might affect tradings

**Drexel Mathematics department**: Studied Hamiltonian Monte Carlo under professor Mondaini

**Drexel Wireless Systems Lab**: an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I did research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods (sequential monte carlo)

**Computer Science Theory Reading Group**: a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), where I gave a talk on Multi Arm bandit algorithm

**Drexel College of Computing and Informatics**: I am/was a Teaching Assistant for courses: Data Structure (fall 2021, winter 2022, spring 2022), Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science (fall 2021), Computer Programming I (fall 2022) & II (winter 2023). My duties includes grading, proctoring exams, hosting labs sessions, and hosting office hours

# Notable courseworks

**Mathematics**: Probability Theory I (graduate course); Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (graduate course); Principle of Analysis I (graduate course); Math of Machine Learning; Linear Algebra; Abstract Algebra I & II; Probability & Statistics I,II; Numerical Analysis I, II; Complex Analysis; Vector Calculus; Mathematical Finance

**Computer Science**: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, Advanced topics in algorithms, Systems Architecture

**Others**: Big Data Physics (Cross-listed with graduate course), Wireless Systems for the IoT, (chemistry) Solutions to climate change, Maths model in Economics, German I to V
