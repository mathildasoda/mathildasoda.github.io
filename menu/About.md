Hello, I'm Mathilda. I just finished my undergraduate with a B.S in Mathematics and a B.S in Computer Science (tracks: AI & ML, Numerical & Symbolic computation). I also hold an Intermediate Proficiency Certificate in German, and a minor in Linguistics.

My main interest lies in Bayesian statistics, and applying mathematical/computational methods to problems in the sciences.

In my free time, you can find me in museumss, at home taking care of my plants, or fixing the various problems [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/) decided to throw at me that month. 

# Experience
**Los Alamos National Lab - Theoretical division**: Researching sampling methods for high dimensional distribution 

**Los Alamos National Lab - Earth & Environmental division**: Contributing to computational fire dynamics code, developing methods in geomorphology

**University of Pennsylvania - Department of Physics & Astronomy**: For my senior thesis, I worked on improving Bayesian Neural Network models for inferrence of structural parameters of galaxies. I also got the chance to see the launch of Euclid telescope in person due to my PI's involvement in the project!

**Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health**: I worked as a Computational Modelling Scientist at Montai for 6 months, during which time I created a machine learning model to predict certain biological properties. On the side, my projects include improving and coding up Bayesian models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for inferrence of biological effects from 2D (quasi-spatial) and 1D data

**Group One Trading LP**: I interned as a trading analyst for 6 months. I learnt option tradings, among other things

**Drexel Wireless Systems Lab**: an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I did research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods (sequential monte carlo)

**Computer Science Theory Reading Group**: a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), where I gave a talk on Multi-armed Bandits algorithm

**Drexel College of Computing and Informatics**: Since 2021 I have been a Teaching Assistant for courses: Data Structure, Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science, Computer Programming I & II. My duties includes grading (written and programming tests/homeworks), proctoring exams, hosting labs sessions and office hours
