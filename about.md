# Me

Hello! I'm Mathilda Nguyen, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My main research is in MCMC methods. My current interests are anything probability, statistics, and calculus.


# Organizations

[Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health](montai.com): I am currently a Computational Modelling Scientist at Montai. I'm creating an ML model to predict some biological properties. On the side, my projects include fitting parameters using Bayesian inference

[Group One Trading LP](group1.com): I was a trading analyst intern for 6 months. I learnt option tradings and conduct a market research on possible future legislation and how it might affect tradings, which was presented to the firm

[Drexel Mathematics department](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/mathematics/): I study Hamiltonian Monte Carlo under professor Mondaini

[Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/): an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I did research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods

[Drexel Computer Science Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html): a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory)

[Drexel College of Computing and Informatics](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/clc/Fa21/index.html): I am a Teaching Assistant for 2 courses: Data Structure, and Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science
