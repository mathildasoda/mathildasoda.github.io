# Me

Hello! I'm Mathilda Nguyen, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My current interests are anything probability, statistics, and calculus. 

Side interests: Currently, I'm reading up on anything Linux, but in the past, I've read about low level programming, game theory (learning algorithm, resource allocation), and some philosophy 


# Organization + my roles

[Drexel Mathematics department](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/mathematics/): Under Dr. Cecilia Mondaini, I study Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, deriving/proving multiple equations by hand, as well as programming multiple Monte Carlo simulations

[Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/): an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I do research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods 

[Drexel Computer Science Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html): a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), I'm also part of a subgroup studying Multi-arm Bandit algorithm. In the past, I have given a talk on intro to Multi-arm Bandit

[Drexel College of Computing and Informatics](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/clc/Fa21/index.html): under the Computer Science department, I am a Teaching Assistant for 2 courses: Data Structure, and Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science
