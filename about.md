# Me

Hello! I'm Mathilda Nguyen, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My current interests are anything probability, statistics, and calculus. These days, I also read up on various Game Theory topics, especially in learning algorithms and resource allocations. 


# Organization + my roles

[Drexel Mathematics department](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/mathematics/): Study Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian Inverse problems under Dr. Cecilia Mondaini

[Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/): an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I do research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods 

[Drexel Computer Science Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html): a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory), I'm also part of a subgroup studying Multi-arm Bandit algorithm
