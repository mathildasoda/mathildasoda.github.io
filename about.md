# Me

Hello! I'm Mathilda Nguyen, an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science (tracks: AI & ML, Numerical & Symbolic computation). My main interest lies in statistical modeling.


# Organizations

[University of Pennsylvania - Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/): I'm working on some ML methods which does regression on galaxy images, with uncertainty quantification

[Flagship Pioneerings - Montai Health](montai.com): I was a Computational Modeling Scientist at Montai. I created an ML model to predict some biological properties. On the side, my projects include using Bayesian methods to infer parameters from bio data (using Stan)

[Group One Trading LP](group1.com): I was a trading analyst intern for 6 months. I learnt option tradings and conducted market research on possible future legislation and how it might affect tradings, which was presented to the firm

[Drexel Mathematics department](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/mathematics/): I study Hamiltonian Monte Carlo under professor Mondaini

[Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/ece/dwsl/): an Engineering Lab at Drexel University, where I did research in dynamics state space approximation and prediction methods

[Drexel Computer Science Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html): a reading group focusing on advanced material in algorithms (especially Game Theory)

[Drexel College of Computing and Informatics](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/clc/Fa21/index.html): I have been a teaching assistant since pre-junior year for courses: Data Structure, Mathematical foundation of Computer Science, Intro to Computer Programming I & II
