My attempt at coding a Trump Tweet Generator. This is done as project for a class (communication/political science) - the report of which is below.

Code can be found: https://github.com/mathildasoda/trumpmarkov/tree/master

For those interested: there are much better trump tweet generator out there (e.g: https://filiph.github.io/markov/). Aside from Trump Tweets, Markov Chain as Text Generators have been done on other text data, one example is Harry Potter (https://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html)
