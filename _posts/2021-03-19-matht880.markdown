The notes from the final presentation for the class MATHT880: Stochastic Partial Differential Equation. It is taken from the book "Stochastic Differential Equations" by Bernt Oksendal, chapter 6: The Filtering Problem. 

The topic is chosen based on my current wish to further understand the mathematical side/construction of filtering problems, which is my research for Drexel's Wireless Systems Lab.
