This is a presentation for a Tech Talk for the Drexel Algorithm & Data Structure club. Tech talks aim to educate people from non STEM backgrounds in algorithms.

Cake cutting is a basic fair division problem in Game Theory, which can have many application in real life, as well as providing incentives for other fair division problems. I encountered this algorithm from attending the talks at the CS Theory Reading Group, and thought that it would be a great algorithm for the tech talk.
