hmmm

$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

This is an inline equation: $$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$,<br>
followed by a display style equation:

$$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$

When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
