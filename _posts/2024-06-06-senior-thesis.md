My senior thesis presentation is below, as you can see I finally managed to find the very nice presentation template that everyone use everywhere - I finally learn to use beamer (sort of)!

An overview: BNN-HI works for training/testing of the same distribution, but not on train-test sets of different distributions. Moreover, there are problems with regard to parameter constrains: hierarchical step necessitates synthetics and posterior distribution belonging to the same family, but such setup is hard to accomplish for current setting of BNN (efforts were made to tackle this problems, documented below. For result, look at next-to-last slide in presentation, for description of method, look at "thesis" document section 2.1.1). In the latter half of my thesis, we changed direction and explored simulation-based inference.

Below is my partly-written "thesis" - I was half way through writing it before learning that a written thesis is not required for my degree. In the end, I decided to post whatever I had written here as it provide better understanding of my work.

I have a few things to say about simulation-based inference through additional work on this thesis this summer, maybe will be a post in the near future...
