My senior thesis presentation is below, as you can see I finally managed to find the very nice presentation template that everyone use everywhere - I finally learn to use beamer!

I'm working on cleaning up the code for this thesis (expect to be done sometimes this summer)

Below is my partly-written "thesis" - I was half way through writing it before learning that a written thesis is not needed for my degree. In the end, I decided to post it becaues it provided deeper theoretical insight into my work - again, please keep in mind that this is not an official thesis.
