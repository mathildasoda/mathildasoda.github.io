This is my presentation for one of the meetings for CS Theory Reading Group. A lot of the material drawn from this presentation is from the book "Bandit Algorithm" by Tor Lattimor.

During the summer, I asked my professors for books on algorithms to read in order to further familiarize myself with the subject. Since my interest at the time was AI/ML, he adviced me to read about multi-arm bandit, as it is a classic reinforcement learning problem, and is a good introduction for someone who has no previous knowledge/training on the matter like me to both algorithms and Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning. This presentation is a product of my reading.
