This is the paper I wrote for the finals of PHYS450/440: Big Data Physics, an undergraduate cross-listed with graduate course on Big Data methods in Python, using Astronomy datasets. 

The topic of the paper, Particle Filter, is chosen from my wish of understanding more about different dynamic state-space approximation algorithms, their pros and cons, as well as their implementation. This is also connected to my research in Drexel Wireless Systems Lab.
